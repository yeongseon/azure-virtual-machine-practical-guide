## Project Overview

**Azure Virtual Machine Practical Guide** — a documentation hub for designing, operating, and troubleshooting Azure Virtual Machines — compute models, disks, networking, availability, backup, and identity.

- **Live site**: <https://yeongseon.github.io/azure-virtual-machine-practical-guide/>
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-virtual-machine-practical-guide>

## Series-Wide Documentation Contract

This repository is part of the Azure Practical Guide series. All repositories in the series must preserve a consistent reader experience while allowing repository-specific extensions.

### Core Sections

Every service-focused repository SHOULD use these core sections unless the repository-specific addendum explains an exception.

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `Start Here` | Yes | Entry points, overview, learning paths, repository map |
| `Platform` | Yes | Service concepts, architecture, core behavior |
| `Best Practices` | Yes | Production patterns, anti-patterns, design guidance |
| `Operations` | Yes | Day-2 operational procedures and verification |
| `Troubleshooting` | Yes | Symptom-based diagnosis, playbooks, evidence collection |
| `Reference` | Yes | CLI, KQL, limits, glossary, decision tables |

### Approved Extension Sections

| Section | Use When |
|---|---|
| `Tutorials` | The repository provides hands-on learning or lab sequences |
| `Lab Guides` | Reproducible experiments or validation exercises are first-class content |
| `Language Guides` | The service has language/runtime-specific implementation tutorials |
| `SDK Guides` | The service is primarily consumed through SDKs |
| `Service Guides` | The repository configures or monitors multiple Azure services |
| `Workload Guides` | The repository is architecture/workload oriented |
| `Architecture Reviews` | The repository includes architecture review methodology and playbooks |
| `Design Labs` | The repository includes architecture design exercises |
| `Visualization` | Visual maps are a deliberate learning surface, not generated leftovers |
| `Meta` | Repository taxonomy, content model, or generated metadata |

Do not create a new top-level section if the content can fit under one of the core or approved extension sections.

```

## Start Here Rules

`Start Here` is orientation content. It must not become a language tutorial, SDK tutorial, operations runbook, troubleshooting playbook, or lab guide.

Required pages:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `overview.md` | Who this guide is for, what is in scope, and what is out of scope |
| `learning-paths.md` | Role-based and experience-based reading paths |
| `repository-map.md` | Map of major sections and when to use them |

Optional pages:

| Page Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `when-to-use-*.md` | Service selection guidance |
| `prerequisites.md` | Required tools, permissions, and accounts |
| `common-scenarios.md` | Common use cases |
| `*-vs-other-compute.md` | Positioning against neighboring Azure services |
| `how-to-use-this-guide.md` | Reader navigation guidance |

`learning-paths.md` MUST:

- Start with role-based or goal-based paths.
- Link to tutorials instead of embedding a full tutorial sequence.
- Avoid service-specific code walkthroughs except short examples.
- Avoid `content_validation` unless this repository explicitly includes Start Here pages in content validation scope.

Preferred title:

```markdown
# Learning Paths
```

Avoid:

```markdown
# Tutorial: {Service} for {Language}
```

## Navigation Budget

The left navigation should help orientation, not expose every file.

Recommended:

- Top-level sections SHOULD stay between 6 and 9 items.
- Direct children under a top-level section SHOULD stay between 5 and 8 items.
- Large collections such as tutorials, recipes, KQL packs, lab guides, and playbooks SHOULD be listed on index pages rather than fully expanded in `mkdocs.yml`.
- Use hub pages, tables, tags, and search for deep inventory.
- Keep `mkdocs.yml` readable enough that a contributor can understand the site structure without scrolling through hundreds of deep links.

Preferred troubleshooting structure:

```text
Troubleshooting
├─ Overview
├─ Quick Diagnosis
├─ Decision Tree
├─ First 10 Minutes
├─ Playbooks
├─ KQL Query Packs
└─ Labs
```

Avoid exposing every individual playbook, KQL query, and lab guide in `mkdocs.yml` unless the repository is intentionally small.

## Content Validation Scope

`content_validation` is required for factual-claim pages, not for every Markdown file.

Required by default:

- `docs/platform/**`
- `docs/best-practices/**`
- `docs/operations/**`
- factual troubleshooting methodology/playbook pages

Usually out of scope:

- `docs/start-here/**`
- `docs/reference/**`
- `docs/language-guides/**`
- `docs/sdk-guides/**`
- `docs/tutorials/**`
- `docs/troubleshooting/kql/**`
- `docs/troubleshooting/lab-guides/**`
- generated dashboards
- navigation-only index pages

Content-type-specific rules:

- Tutorials use `validation`.
- Labs use evidence and falsification integrity.
- KQL packs document query purpose, expected interpretation, required tables, and assumptions.
- KQL packs do not need `content_validation` unless they make factual platform claims outside the query explanation.
- Never fabricate validation dates or test results.

## Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid diagrams when they clarify architecture, flow, dependency, decision logic, or troubleshooting paths.

Required for:

- Platform architecture pages
- Complex operations pages
- Decision trees
- Troubleshooting playbooks with multi-step diagnosis
- Lab guides with failure progression or evidence timelines
- Architecture review or design decision flows

Optional for:

- Reference tables
- CLI cheatsheets
- Glossary pages
- Generated validation dashboards
- Short landing pages
- Simple tutorial steps where prose is clearer

Do not add a diagram just to satisfy a checkbox. A diagram must explain something better than prose or a table.

### Diagram Orientation Rule

- **Sequential flows with 5+ nodes**: Use `flowchart TD` (top-down) to prevent horizontal overflow.
- **Short diagrams with fewer than 5 nodes**: `flowchart LR` (left-right) is acceptable.
- **Layered architecture diagrams** (e.g., network layers, stack diagrams): Always use `flowchart TD`.

```mermaid
%% CORRECT — 5+ node sequential flow uses TD
flowchart TD
    A[Commit] --> B[Build and test]
    B --> C[Package artifact]
    C --> D[Deploy to staging]
    D --> E[Validation]
    E --> F[Swap to production]

%% WRONG — long horizontal overflow
flowchart LR
    A[Commit] --> B[Build and test] --> C[Package] --> D[Deploy] --> E[Validate] --> F[Swap]
```

## Image and Screenshot Rules

Images must support the reader's task. Do not add screenshots only for decoration.

Every referenced image MUST have:

- Descriptive alt text.
- A nearby explanation of what the reader should verify.
- No real subscription IDs, tenant IDs, object IDs, emails, phone numbers, secrets, keys, connection strings, or customer data.
- Visual verification before merge when the image is referenced from Markdown.

Recommended explanation pattern:

```markdown
![Container App overview showing a healthy revision](../assets/example.png)

Purpose: Confirm why this image exists.
Look for: Tell the reader what values or states to confirm.
Expected result: State the healthy or expected condition.
Next step: Link the image to the next action.
```

Portal screenshots:

- Prefer text replacement over black-box redaction.
- Use black-box masking only for unavoidable avatar/profile pixels and only with the repository-approved mask color.
- If a screenshot cannot be visually verified, remove the Markdown reference or disclose the debt explicitly in the PR.

## Microsoft Learn URL Locale

All `learn.microsoft.com` URLs SHOULD use the `en-us` locale prefix.

Canonical form:

```text
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/{service}/...
```

Avoid locale-less URLs (URLs missing the `/en-us/` segment immediately after the hostname):

```text
https://learn.microsoft.com/<missing-locale>/azure/{service}/...
```

The `<missing-locale>` placeholder marks the position where `/en-us/` must appear. A real locale-less URL would omit that segment entirely; the placeholder is used here only so this anti-pattern example does not trip the `scripts/normalize_mslearn_locale.py` CI gate.

Reason:

- Stable reader experience.
- Stable reviewer experience.
- Easier link checking.
- Less URL drift across repositories.

## Documentation Conventions

### File Naming

- All files: `topic-name.md` (kebab-case)
- Index files: `index.md` in each directory

### CLI Command Style

```bash
# ALWAYS use long flags for readability
az vm create --resource-group $RG --name $VM_NAME --image $IMAGE --location $LOCATION

# NEVER use short flags in documentation
az vm create -g $RG -n $VM_NAME  # ❌ Don't do this
```

### Variable Naming Convention

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$RG` | Resource group name | `rg-vm-demo` |
| `$VM_NAME` | Virtual machine name | `vm-app-001` |
| `$IMAGE` | VM image | `Ubuntu2204` |
| `$SIZE` | VM size | `Standard_D2s_v3` |
| `$LOCATION` | Azure region | `koreacentral` |
| `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Subscription identifier placeholder | `<subscription-id>` |

## Content Source Requirements

### MSLearn-First Policy
All content MUST be traceable to official Microsoft Learn documentation:

- **Platform content** (`docs/platform/`): MUST have direct MSLearn source URLs
- **Architecture diagrams**: MUST reference official Microsoft documentation
- **Troubleshooting playbooks**: MAY synthesize MSLearn content with clear attribution
- **Self-generated content**: MUST have justification explaining the source basis

### Source Types
| Type | Description | Allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| `mslearn` | Directly from Microsoft Learn | ✅ Required for platform content |
| `mslearn-adapted` | MSLearn content adapted for this guide | ✅ With source URL |
| `self-generated` | Original content for this guide | ⚠️ Requires justification |
| `community` | From community sources | ❌ Not for core content |
| `unknown` | Source not documented | ❌ Must be validated |

### Diagram Source Documentation
Every Mermaid diagram MUST have source metadata in frontmatter:

```yaml
content_sources:
  diagrams:
    - id: architecture-overview
      type: flowchart
      source: mslearn
      mslearn_url: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/
    - id: troubleshooting-flow
      type: flowchart
      source: self-generated
      justification: "Synthesized from MSLearn articles for clarity"
      based_on:
        - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/
```

### Content Validation Tracking
- See [Content Validation Status](docs/reference/content-validation-status.md) for current status
- See [Validation Status](docs/reference/validation-status.md) for tutorial testing

### Text Content Validation

Factual-claim documents include a `content_validation` block in frontmatter to track the verification status of their core claims. See `## Content Validation Scope` above for the required paths and out-of-scope paths.

```yaml
---
content_sources:
  - type: mslearn-adapted
    url: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/...
content_validation:
  status: verified  # verified | pending_review | unverified
  last_reviewed: 2026-04-12
  reviewer: agent  # agent | human
  core_claims:
    - claim: "Azure VMs support multiple OS images"
      source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/overview
      verified: true
---
```

### PII Removal (Quality Gate)

**CRITICAL**: All CLI output examples MUST have PII removed.

**Must mask (real Azure identifiers):**

- Subscription IDs: `<subscription-id>`
- Tenant IDs: `<tenant-id>`
- Object IDs: `<object-id>`
- Resource IDs containing real subscription/tenant
- Emails: Remove or mask as `user@example.com`
- IP addresses: Use RFC 5737 ranges (192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24)
- SSH keys: NEVER include private keys
- Passwords: NEVER include

**OK to keep (synthetic example values):**

- Demo correlation IDs: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`
- Example request IDs in logs
- Placeholder domains: `example.com`, `contoso.com`
- Sample resource names used consistently in docs

The goal is to prevent leaking **real Azure account information**, not to mask obviously-fake example values that aid readability.

### Admonition Indentation Rule

For MkDocs admonitions (`!!!` / `???`), every line in the body must be indented by **4 spaces**.

```markdown
!!! warning "Important"
    This line is correctly indented.

    - List item also inside
```

### Nested List Indentation

All nested list items MUST use **4-space indent** (Python-Markdown standard).

### Tail Section Naming

Every document ends with these tail sections (in this order):

| Section | Purpose | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `## See Also` | Internal cross-links within this repository | Links to other pages in this guide |
| `## Sources` | External authoritative references | Links to Microsoft Learn (primary) |

- `## See Also` is required on every page.
- `## Sources` is required when external references are cited.
- Order is always `## See Also` → `## Sources` (never reversed).

```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`

## Tutorial Validation Tracking

Every tutorial document supports **validation frontmatter** that records when and how it was last tested against a real deployment.

### Frontmatter Schema

Add a `validation` block inside the YAML frontmatter (`---` fences) of any tutorial file:

```yaml
---
hide:
  - toc
validation:
  az_cli:
    last_tested: 2026-04-09
    cli_version: "2.83.0"
    result: pass
  bicep:
    last_tested: null
    result: not_tested
---
```

### Agent Rules for Validation

1. **After deploying a tutorial end-to-end**, add or update the `validation` frontmatter with the current date, CLI version, and `result: pass`.
2. **If a tutorial step fails during validation**, set `result: fail` and note the issue.
3. **Never fabricate validation dates.**
4. **After updating frontmatter**, regenerate the dashboard:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/generate_validation_status.py
    ```
5. **Include the regenerated dashboard** (`docs/reference/validation-status.md`) in the same commit.
6. **Do not manually edit** `docs/reference/validation-status.md` — it is auto-generated.
