## Project Overview

**Azure Virtual Machine Practical Guide** — a documentation hub for designing, operating, and troubleshooting Azure Virtual Machines — compute models, disks, networking, availability, backup, and identity.

- **Live site**: <https://yeongseon.github.io/azure-virtual-machine-practical-guide/>
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-virtual-machine-practical-guide>

## Series-Wide Documentation Contract

This repository is part of the Azure Practical Guide series. All repositories in the series must preserve a consistent reader experience while allowing repository-specific extensions.

### Core Sections

Every service-focused repository SHOULD use these core sections unless the repository-specific addendum explains an exception.

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `Start Here` | Yes | Entry points, overview, learning paths, repository map |
| `Platform` | Yes | Service concepts, architecture, core behavior |
| `Best Practices` | Yes | Production patterns, anti-patterns, design guidance |
| `Operations` | Yes | Day-2 operational procedures and verification |
| `Troubleshooting` | Yes | Symptom-based diagnosis, playbooks, evidence collection |
| `Reference` | Yes | CLI, KQL, limits, glossary, decision tables |

### Approved Extension Sections

| Section | Use When |
|---|---|
| `Tutorials` | The repository provides hands-on learning or lab sequences |
| `Lab Guides` | Reproducible experiments or validation exercises are first-class content |
| `Language Guides` | The service has language/runtime-specific implementation tutorials |
| `SDK Guides` | The service is primarily consumed through SDKs |
| `Service Guides` | The repository configures or monitors multiple Azure services |
| `Workload Guides` | The repository is architecture/workload oriented |
| `Architecture Reviews` | The repository includes architecture review methodology and playbooks |
| `Design Labs` | The repository includes architecture design exercises |
| `Visualization` | Visual maps are a deliberate learning surface, not generated leftovers |
| `Meta` | Repository taxonomy, content model, or generated metadata |

Do not create a new top-level section if the content can fit under one of the core or approved extension sections.

## Start Here Rules

`Start Here` is orientation content. It must not become a language tutorial, SDK tutorial, operations runbook, troubleshooting playbook, or lab guide.

Required pages:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `overview.md` | Who this guide is for, what is in scope, and what is out of scope |
| `learning-paths.md` | Role-based and experience-based reading paths |
| `repository-map.md` | Map of major sections and when to use them |

Optional pages:

| Page Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `when-to-use-*.md` | Service selection guidance |
| `prerequisites.md` | Required tools, permissions, and accounts |
| `common-scenarios.md` | Common use cases |
| `*-vs-other-compute.md` | Positioning against neighboring Azure services |
| `how-to-use-this-guide.md` | Reader navigation guidance |

`learning-paths.md` MUST:

- Start with role-based or goal-based paths.
- Link to tutorials instead of embedding a full tutorial sequence.
- Avoid service-specific code walkthroughs except short examples.
- Avoid `content_validation` unless this repository explicitly includes Start Here pages in content validation scope.

Preferred title:

```markdown
# Learning Paths
```

Avoid:

```markdown
# Tutorial: {Service} for {Language}
```

## Navigation Budget

The left navigation should help orientation, not expose every file.

Recommended:

- Top-level sections SHOULD stay between 6 and 9 items.
- Direct children under a top-level section SHOULD stay between 5 and 8 items.
- Large collections such as tutorials, recipes, KQL packs, lab guides, and playbooks SHOULD be listed on index pages rather than fully expanded in `mkdocs.yml`.
- Use hub pages, tables, tags, and search for deep inventory.
- Keep `mkdocs.yml` readable enough that a contributor can understand the site structure without scrolling through hundreds of deep links.

Preferred troubleshooting structure:

```text
Troubleshooting
├─ Overview
├─ Quick Diagnosis
├─ Decision Tree
├─ First 10 Minutes
├─ Playbooks
├─ KQL Query Packs
└─ Labs
```

Avoid exposing every individual playbook, KQL query, and lab guide in `mkdocs.yml` unless the repository is intentionally small.

## Content Validation Scope

`content_validation` is required for factual-claim pages, not for every Markdown file.

Required by default:

- `docs/platform/**`
- `docs/best-practices/**`
- `docs/operations/**`
- factual troubleshooting methodology/playbook pages

Usually out of scope:

- `docs/start-here/**`
- `docs/reference/**`
- `docs/language-guides/**`
- `docs/sdk-guides/**`
- `docs/tutorials/**`
- `docs/troubleshooting/kql/**`
- `docs/troubleshooting/lab-guides/**`
- generated dashboards
- navigation-only index pages

Content-type-specific rules:

- Tutorials use `validation`.
- Labs use evidence and falsification integrity.
- KQL packs document query purpose, expected interpretation, required tables, and assumptions.
- KQL packs do not need `content_validation` unless they make factual platform claims outside the query explanation.
- Never fabricate validation dates or test results.

## Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid diagrams when they clarify architecture, flow, dependency, decision logic, or troubleshooting paths.

Required for:

- Platform architecture pages
- Complex operations pages
- Decision trees
- Troubleshooting playbooks with multi-step diagnosis
- Lab guides with failure progression or evidence timelines
- Architecture review or design decision flows

Optional for:

- Reference tables
- CLI cheatsheets
- Glossary pages
- Generated validation dashboards
- Short landing pages
- Simple tutorial steps where prose is clearer

Do not add a diagram just to satisfy a checkbox. A diagram must explain something better than prose or a table.

### Diagram Orientation Rule

- **Sequential flows with 5+ nodes**: Use `flowchart TD` (top-down) to prevent horizontal overflow.
- **Short diagrams with fewer than 5 nodes**: `flowchart LR` (left-right) is acceptable.
- **Layered architecture diagrams** (e.g., network layers, stack diagrams): Always use `flowchart TD`.

```mermaid
%% CORRECT — 5+ node sequential flow uses TD
flowchart TD
    A[Commit] --> B[Build and test]
    B --> C[Package artifact]
    C --> D[Deploy to staging]
    D --> E[Validation]
    E --> F[Swap to production]

%% WRONG — long horizontal overflow
flowchart LR
    A[Commit] --> B[Build and test] --> C[Package] --> D[Deploy] --> E[Validate] --> F[Swap]
```

## Image and Screenshot Rules

Images must support the reader's task. Do not add screenshots only for decoration.

Every referenced image MUST have:

- Descriptive alt text.
- A nearby explanation of what the reader should verify.
- No real subscription IDs, tenant IDs, object IDs, emails, phone numbers, secrets, keys, connection strings, or customer data.
- Visual verification before merge when the image is referenced from Markdown.

Recommended explanation pattern:

```markdown
![Container App overview showing a healthy revision](../assets/example.png)

Purpose: Confirm why this image exists.
Look for: Tell the reader what values or states to confirm.
Expected result: State the healthy or expected condition.
Next step: Link the image to the next action.
```

Portal screenshots:

- Prefer text replacement over black-box redaction.
- Use black-box masking only for unavoidable avatar/profile pixels and only with the repository-approved mask color.
- If a screenshot cannot be visually verified, remove the Markdown reference or disclose the debt explicitly in the PR.

### Manifest-driven capture pipeline

Portal screenshots are managed as **build artifacts driven by a manifest** (`scripts/capture/`), not hand-placed files. Docs reference a screenshot by a **stable ID** via the `shot()` macro, so re-capturing a blade overwrites the same `.webp` and never requires editing markdown.

- Register every capture in `scripts/capture/manifest.yaml` with a stable `id` (equal to the file stem), `file` path under `docs/assets/`, and accurate `alt` text.
- Reference it in markdown with `[[[ shot("<id>") ]]]` (custom Jinja delimiters `[[[ ]]]` / `[[% %]]` / `[[# #]]`, configured in `mkdocs.yml`, avoid collisions with `{{ }}`).
- Encode/downscale raw PNGs to WebP with the `capture-optimize-webp` CLI; refresh existing captures through the `capture-diff-gate` CLI (both provided by the `azure-guide-capture-toolkit` package; below `diff_threshold` only `verified` is bumped, image bytes untouched).
- Screenshots may be committed as WebP produced by this pipeline. When a capture is optimized to WebP, the **final rendered `.webp`** — not only the raw PNG — MUST be visually verified for PII and caption accuracy before merge. A PII or caption defect introduced or hidden by re-encoding is treated the same as one in a raw PNG.
- See `scripts/capture/README.md` for the full workflow.

### Authenticating the capture browser (Conditional Access)

If this repository adds Azure Portal captures, the capture browser MUST reuse a **device-compliant, interactively signed-in** session. A fresh, isolated Chromium — whether launched by standalone Playwright or by the MCP browser tool — is **not** an Intune-enrolled / device-compliant browser, so it CANNOT pass Microsoft Entra Conditional Access for the MSIT (`ms.portal.azure.com`) tenant. It loops on the sign-in / `ConditionalAccess/Enrollment` ("install Company Portal") wall. **Do not** burn cycles trying to defeat this from automation — it is a device-level security control, not a cookie problem.

Working pattern (attach to a real, human-authenticated Chrome over CDP):

1. **Launch the user's Chrome with a dedicated debug profile and a remote-debugging port.** A dedicated `--user-data-dir` avoids Chrome's block on debugging the default profile, and OS-level Platform SSO / Company Portal still satisfies device compliance:
    ```bash
    "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
      --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
      --user-data-dir="$HOME/.chrome-portal-capture" \
      --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check \
      "https://ms.portal.azure.com/"
    ```
2. **The human signs in interactively (including MFA) and navigates to the target blade.** The agent CANNOT complete MFA — hand this step to the user explicitly and wait.
3. **Verify the port is bound before attaching:** `curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version`, and poll `http://localhost:9222/json` to detect when the target blade URL has loaded.
4. **Attach Playwright over CDP** with `chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222')`, pick the page whose URL contains `portal.azure.com`, apply the PII replacements, then screenshot. `browser.close()` on a CDP-attached browser only detaches the debugger; it does NOT close the user's Chrome.

Common failure: relaunching the Chrome binary while Chrome is already running just opens a tab in the existing (non-debug) process and silently ignores `--remote-debugging-port`. Always confirm the port with `curl`/`nc` before assuming the debug instance is up.

## Microsoft Learn URL Locale

All `learn.microsoft.com` URLs SHOULD use the `en-us` locale prefix.

Canonical form:

```text
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/{service}/...
```

Avoid locale-less URLs (URLs missing the `/en-us/` segment immediately after the hostname):

```text
https://learn.microsoft.com/<missing-locale>/azure/{service}/...
```

The `<missing-locale>` placeholder marks the position where `/en-us/` must appear. A real locale-less URL would omit that segment entirely; the placeholder is used here only so this anti-pattern example does not trip the `scripts/normalize_mslearn_locale.py` CI gate.

Reason:

- Stable reader experience.
- Stable reviewer experience.
- Easier link checking.
- Less URL drift across repositories.

## Content Categories

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Start Here** | Entry points, learning paths, overview |
| **Platform** | Architecture, design decisions — WHAT and HOW it works |
| **Best Practices** | Production patterns — HOW to use the platform well |
| **Operations** | Day-2 execution — HOW to run in production |
| **Troubleshooting** | Diagnosis and resolution |

### Evidence Annotation Policy

The evidence-tag pattern above is a differentiator for this series, but it is an **evidence-annotation tool, not a global writing style**. Applying tags to every image, paragraph, and orientation page causes *annotation fatigue* (readers stop reading them) and invites the `[Observed]`-as-OCR-dump anti-pattern (dumping the full Portal UI text instead of task-relevant values). Scope the tags by document type.

**Where evidence tags are required:**

- Troubleshooting lab guides
- Experiment logs
- KQL result interpretation
- Portal evidence sections
- Incident-style diagnostic walkthroughs

**Where evidence tags are optional:**

- Troubleshooting playbooks (decision points only)
- Platform deep dives (only where documented facts and observed behavior diverge)
- Operations verification sections
- Advanced diagnostic tutorials

**Where evidence tags should usually be avoided:**

- `Start Here`, `Learning Paths`, repository maps
- README files
- Glossary pages and CLI cheatsheets
- Simple tutorial steps
- Navigation-only index pages

**Writing rules — Do:**

- Keep `[Observed]` short and limited to task-relevant facts.
- Use `[Measured]` for numeric query or metric results.
- Use `[Inferred]` only when the reasoning depends on observations.
- Use `[Not Proven]` when a screenshot or query does not fully prove the claim.
- Put long evidence details in collapsible `??? note "Evidence notes"` blocks.

**Writing rules — Do not:**

- Use `[Observed]` as an OCR dump of the entire screen.
- Put long Portal UI text in image alt text.
- Use evidence tags to make normal prose look more rigorous.
- Treat `[Inferred]` as a substitute for Microsoft Learn sourcing.
- Force evidence tags into Start Here or Learning Paths pages.

Document-type matrix:

| Document type | Usage |
|---|---|
| Troubleshooting lab guide | Required |
| Incident-style experiment log | Required |
| KQL result interpretation | Strongly recommended (`[Measured]` / `[Observed]` / `[Inferred]`) |
| Portal evidence screenshot | Strongly recommended, kept short |
| Troubleshooting playbook | Recommended (decision points only) |
| Platform deep-dive | Optional (only where docs and observations diverge) |
| Language tutorial | Limited ("Verify" step only, short) |
| Start Here / Overview / Learning Paths | Nearly forbidden |
| Reference / CLI cheatsheet / glossary | Nearly forbidden (metric-capture reference pages excepted) |
| README / landing page | Effectively forbidden |

This policy is tracked series-wide in [issue #296](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-container-apps-practical-guide/issues/296).

### Screenshot Evidence Pattern

For tutorial and Portal screenshots, prefer this structure over inline OCR dumps:

```markdown
![Short descriptive alt text](../assets/example.png)

Purpose: Explain why this screenshot is included.
Look for: List the 2-4 values the reader should verify.
Expected result: State the healthy or expected condition.
Next step: Point to the next action.

??? note "Evidence notes"
    [Observed] Short task-relevant observation.

    [Inferred] Interpretation based on the observation.

    [Not Proven] What this screenshot alone does not prove.
```

Rules:

- Alt text describes the image, not every visible UI value.
- `[Observed]` includes only values relevant to the task.
- Long raw observations move into the collapsible block.
- Never include real public IPs, subscription names, tenant IDs, object IDs, emails, secrets, or connection strings in alt text or evidence notes.

## Documentation Conventions

### File Naming

- All files: `topic-name.md` (kebab-case)
- Index files: `index.md` in each directory

### CLI Command Style

```bash
# ALWAYS use long flags for readability
az vm create --resource-group $RG --name $VM_NAME --image $IMAGE --location $LOCATION

# NEVER use short flags in documentation
az vm create -g $RG -n $VM_NAME  # ❌ Don't do this
```

### CLI Explanation Table Rule (Quality Gate)

Every `bash` code fence that contains an `az ...` command MUST be immediately followed by a `| Command | Purpose |` explanation table listing the base command plus every long flag used, one row each. This is enforced by `scripts/validate_cli_explanations.py` (wired into the `Validate CLI Explanation Tables` CI job).

**MANDATORY: the explanation table MUST be terminated by a blank line** (or end-of-file). A table that directly abuts the following line — `Example output:`, a `` ``` `` code fence, or any prose — is a **rendering defect**, not a cosmetic one.

Why this is mandatory, and why generic gates miss it:

- Python-Markdown's `tables` extension is block-level: it requires a blank line **after** the table. Without it, the first following non-blank line is silently absorbed **into the table as a phantom row** (e.g. `Example output:` renders as `<td>Example output:</td><td></td>`), corrupting both the table and the following block.
- **`mkdocs build --strict` does NOT catch this.** Strict mode fails only on broken links and nav warnings; a malformed-but-parseable table still "builds" clean. A green strict build is therefore **not** evidence that tables render correctly.
- **Source-only review (including Oracle text review) does NOT catch this.** Reviewing the Markdown source (which looks fine line-by-line) cannot reveal a rendering-level absorption bug. Rendered-HTML verification is required.
- A table-existence check is insufficient: a validator that only asserts "a table follows the fence" will pass a table missing its trailing blank line. The validator MUST also assert table **termination** (blank line or EOF). `find_unterminated_tables()` in `scripts/validate_cli_explanations.py` enforces this, and its doctests are the executable spec.

Correct:

```markdown
| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `az group create` | Create a resource group. |
| `--name` | Name of the resource group. |

Example output:
```

Broken (no blank line — `Example output:` is absorbed as a phantom table row):

```markdown
| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `az group create` | Create a resource group. |
| `--name` | Name of the resource group. |
Example output:
```

When generating or inserting explanation tables in bulk, always re-verify with the validator **and** spot-check the rendered HTML. Any scanner MUST skip fenced code regions, because KQL blocks use line-leading `|` (`| where`, `| summarize`) that would otherwise be miscounted as table rows — causing both false positives and missed real defects.

### Variable Naming Convention

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$RG` | Resource group name | `rg-vm-demo` |
| `$VM_NAME` | Virtual machine name | `vm-app-001` |
| `$IMAGE` | VM image | `Ubuntu2204` |
| `$SIZE` | VM size | `Standard_D2s_v3` |
| `$LOCATION` | Azure region | `koreacentral` |
| `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Subscription identifier placeholder | `<subscription-id>` |

## Content Source Requirements

### MSLearn-First Policy
All content MUST be traceable to official Microsoft Learn documentation:

- **Platform content** (`docs/platform/`): MUST have direct MSLearn source URLs
- **Architecture diagrams**: MUST reference official Microsoft documentation
- **Troubleshooting playbooks**: MAY synthesize MSLearn content with clear attribution
- **Self-generated content**: MUST have justification explaining the source basis

### Source Types
| Type | Description | Allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| `mslearn` | Directly from Microsoft Learn | ✅ Required for platform content |
| `mslearn-adapted` | MSLearn content adapted for this guide | ✅ With source URL |
| `self-generated` | Original content for this guide | ⚠️ Requires justification |
| `community` | From community sources | ❌ Not for core content |
| `unknown` | Source not documented | ❌ Must be validated |

### Diagram Source Documentation
Every Mermaid diagram MUST have source metadata in frontmatter:

```yaml
content_sources:
  diagrams:
    - id: architecture-overview
      type: flowchart
      source: mslearn
      mslearn_url: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/
    - id: troubleshooting-flow
      type: flowchart
      source: self-generated
      justification: "Synthesized from MSLearn articles for clarity"
      based_on:
        - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/
```

### Content Validation Tracking
- See [Content Validation Status](docs/reference/content-validation-status.md) for current status
- See [Validation Status](docs/reference/validation-status.md) for tutorial testing

### Text Content Validation

Factual-claim documents include a `content_validation` block in frontmatter to track the verification status of their core claims. See `## Content Validation Scope` above for the required paths and out-of-scope paths.

```yaml
---
content_sources:
  - type: mslearn-adapted
    url: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/...
content_validation:
  status: verified  # verified | pending_review | unverified
  last_reviewed: 2026-04-12
  reviewer: agent  # agent | human
  core_claims:
    - claim: "Azure VMs support multiple OS images"
      source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/overview
      verified: true
---
```

### PII Removal (Quality Gate)

**CRITICAL**: All CLI output examples MUST have PII removed.

**Must mask (real Azure identifiers):**

- Subscription IDs: `<subscription-id>`
- Tenant IDs: `<tenant-id>`
- Object IDs: `<object-id>`
- Resource IDs containing real subscription/tenant
- Emails: Remove or mask as `user@example.com`
- IP addresses: Use RFC 5737 ranges (192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24)
- SSH keys: NEVER include private keys
- Passwords: NEVER include

**OK to keep (synthetic example values):**

- Demo correlation IDs: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`
- Example request IDs in logs
- Placeholder domains: `example.com`, `contoso.com`
- Sample resource names used consistently in docs

The goal is to prevent leaking **real Azure account information**, not to mask obviously-fake example values that aid readability.

### Admonition Indentation Rule

For MkDocs admonitions (`!!!` / `???`), every line in the body must be indented by **4 spaces**.

```markdown
!!! warning "Important"
    This line is correctly indented.

    - List item also inside
```

### Nested List Indentation

All nested list items MUST use **4-space indent** (Python-Markdown standard).

### Tail Section Naming

Every document ends with these tail sections (in this order):

| Section | Purpose | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `## See Also` | Internal cross-links within this repository | Links to other pages in this guide |
| `## Sources` | External authoritative references | Links to Microsoft Learn (primary) |

- `## See Also` is required on every page.
- `## Sources` is required when external references are cited.
- Order is always `## See Also` → `## Sources` (never reversed).

## Documentation Repetition Gate (Quality Gate)

Run `python scripts/detect_repetition.py docs` to catch generator-produced boilerplate — non-trivial prose lines repeated within a single Markdown page. Repeats matching a known scaffold marker in `scripts/repetition-markers.txt` **fail CI** (ERROR); any other significant repeat is reported as a non-blocking WARN. The detector excludes YAML frontmatter, fenced code blocks, and table/KQL-pipe rows, and honors a per-repo `scripts/repetition-allowlist.txt` of exact lines that are legitimately repeated. Prefer removing boilerplate over allowlisting it. Enforced by the `Validate Documentation Repetition` CI job, which also runs the detector's doctests (`python -m doctest scripts/detect_repetition.py -v`). This gate is the Prevention arm of the cross-repo boilerplate-audit epic ([azure-container-apps-practical-guide#376](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-container-apps-practical-guide/issues/376)); it is vendored per repository so each guide carries its own script, workflow, markers, and allowlist.

## PII Detection Gate (Quality Gate)

Run `python scripts/validate_pii.py` to scan `docs/` for leaked identifiers before they reach the public site. The gate flags UUID-shaped subscription/tenant/object IDs and real email addresses (outside documentation-safe domains) as **blocking**, and RFC 1918 private IPv4 addresses as **advisory** (non-blocking) — private ranges are non-routable and used throughout the series as teaching examples. Synthetic UUIDs (all-same-character, uniform hyphen groups, sequential-hex runs such as `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`), documented public Azure built-in role definition IDs, and safe email domains (`example.com`, `contoso.com`, reserved TLDs like `.example`/`.test`, and `*.azurecomm.net`) are recognized automatically. A per-repo `scripts/pii-allowlist.txt` holds any additional confirmed-safe example values. In CI the `Validate PII` job runs the detector's doctests, blocks on **changed Markdown files only** (`--files`, so historical debt never becomes a permanent failure), and runs a full-repo advisory scan for visibility. This gate is a Prevention item of the cross-repo quality-gate audit ([azure-container-apps-practical-guide#384](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-container-apps-practical-guide/issues/384)); it is vendored per repository so each guide carries its own script, workflow, and allowlist.

```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`

## Tutorial Validation Tracking

Every tutorial document supports **validation frontmatter** that records when and how it was last tested against a real deployment.

### Frontmatter Schema

Add a `validation` block inside the YAML frontmatter (`---` fences) of any tutorial file:

```yaml
---
hide:
  - toc
validation:
  az_cli:
    last_tested: 2026-04-09
    cli_version: "2.83.0"
    result: pass
  bicep:
    last_tested: null
    result: not_tested
---
```

### Agent Rules for Validation

1. **After deploying a tutorial end-to-end**, add or update the `validation` frontmatter with the current date, CLI version, and `result: pass`.
2. **If a tutorial step fails during validation**, set `result: fail` and note the issue.
3. **Never fabricate validation dates.**
4. **After updating frontmatter**, regenerate the dashboard:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/generate_validation_status.py
    ```
5. **Include the regenerated dashboard** (`docs/reference/validation-status.md`) in the same commit.
6. **Do not manually edit** `docs/reference/validation-status.md` — it is auto-generated.

## Merge Policy (AI Agent Rule)

AI agents MAY merge their own pull requests **autonomously**, but ONLY after ALL of the mandatory gates below pass. There is no separate human approval step — passing every gate IS the approval. If any gate cannot be satisfied, the agent MUST stop and hand the PR to the user instead of merging.

### Mandatory merge gates (ALL required)

| # | Gate | How it is verified |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Oracle review ≥ 90/100** | Submit the final diff to Oracle for quality review. Score must be **90 or higher with no merge-blocking issues**. Any must-fix item is a blocker even at ≥ 90. |
| 2 | **CI fully green** | Every required GitHub Actions check on the PR head SHA passes. Verify with `gh pr checks <pr> --watch`; do not merge on `pending` or `failure`. |
| 3 | **Caption ↔ image match** | For every added/changed image referenced from markdown, the caption/alt text MUST accurately describe the actual rendered image. |
| 4 | **Final-image PII verification** | Every added/changed `.png`/`.webp` referenced from markdown MUST be visually verified (Read/`look_at`) for PII on the **final committed bytes** — zeroed subscription/tenant IDs, no employee identifiers, no black-box masks. WebP re-encodes are re-verified, not assumed from the raw PNG. |

### Merge procedure

1. Confirm gates 1-4 above, in order. Record the Oracle score and the visual-verification result in the PR thread or the final summary.
2. Merge with **squash-and-merge** only:

    ```bash
    gh pr merge <pr> --squash --delete-branch
    ```

3. Never use merge-commit or rebase-merge; squash keeps `main` history linear and collapses fixup commits.
4. Never bypass a failing or pending gate. Never merge with `--admin` to skip checks.

### When to stop instead of merging

- Oracle score < 90, or any unresolved must-fix.
- Any CI check failing or still pending.
- Any referenced image that cannot be visually verified.
- The PR touches something outside the agent's stated scope.

In these cases, report the blocking gate and hand off to the user.
